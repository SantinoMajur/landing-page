## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind css
- postcss prefixers
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While tackling this project, I got a firm grasp of tailwind css and how to configure my own themes.
```js
 theme: {
    extend: {
      width: {
        '66':'46%'
      },
      maxWidth: {
        '235': '235px',
        '350': '350px',
        '150': '150px'
      },
      minHeight: {
        '300': '300px',
        '270': '270px'
      },
      screens: {
        'xs': '350px'
      }
    },
  },
```
I learned about responsive design and how to use which are very max-width are very powerful and I got to understand how the work in conjucture with min-heights.

### Continued development

They say practices make perfect, I still get confused about positionings and how to divide space for flex items and I believe those are the areas I would have to practice more plus I haven't tackle transitions, tranforms and animations plus some pseudo classes.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/) - This website has been my go to during the project to understand a few concepts like flexbox, responsive design, responsive images and background-images.
- [Resource 2](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Best documentation that I have ever come in contact with, the way the explain the utility classes and the components was on point plus the search engine was the stand component on the website
- [Resource 3](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tailwind+css+from+zero+to+production) - This channel on youtube encouraged me to switch to tailwind css, the way they were explaining every things was what got me hooked with Tailwind css
